Nicoya is a district in the Guanacaste region of Costa Rica. It is famous for being one of the six world wide bluezones. A bluezone is a place on earth that has a significantly higher average life span compared to the rest of the world.

## Diet

Centarians in Nicoya eat a diet that is distinctly different from a typical western diet. In the United States of America. People in Nicoya get most of the carbohydrates from grains, vegetables, and fruit, along with eating a large amount of dairy. One centarian who is still active and sharp eats a breakfast of rice, beans, tortillas, and black coffee everyday. Tortias are hand made in Nicoya with whole corn.

## Comparison

As mentioned above, the Nicoyan diet is very different compared to the average resident of the United States of America. Some examples of this are the differnces of views on some foods. The breakfast mentioned above might be seen as unhealth in the United States of America, but obviously, it is quite healthy. Another example of the differences between these diets is the consumption of meat or fish. In the US, there is a large culture of eating meat, but in Nicoya, the average centarian's diet only consists of 5% meat or fish!

## Recipe

A recipe that fits into the Nicoyan diet could be pizza with whole grains, as a quarter of the diet is grain, and a quarter is dairy. You also can get fruit from tomatoes, and protien from your pizza toppings.
